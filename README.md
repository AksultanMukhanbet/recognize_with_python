This repository contains a set of experiments on survivability.

Why do we need an algorithm that determines survivability? Let's say you have a facial recognition system, and a certain user tried to intentionally bypass your facial recognition system. Such a user may try to show a photo of another person. They may even have a photo or video on their smartphone, which they can transmit to the camera responsible for facial recognition (for example, in the image at the top of this post).

In such situations, it is quite possible that the face held up to the camera will be correctly recognized ... but this will eventually lead to an unauthorized user bypassing your facial recognition system!
